/**
 * Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
 *
 * answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
 * answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
 * answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
 * answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
 *
 * input: n = 15
 * output: [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz"....."FizzBuzz"]
 *
 *
 * * How would I approach this?
 *
 * * Firstly I know we're working with an array that will hold our string so i will
 * * initialize an empty array to hold everything
 *
 * * n will be the end integer and we're iterating[i] over all the numbers between 1 and n
 *
