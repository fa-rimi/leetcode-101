Hash -> unique ID
Hash Function -> takes a input and returns an output
HashSet -> stores the Hash(unique ID)

set vs array:
in order to find a value in an array you need to go through the all the items in order to find it
but in a set you dont have to go through all of the items
- set will use Hash Function to locate the item using its unique ID
